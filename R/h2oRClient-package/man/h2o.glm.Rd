\title{
H2O: Generalized Linear Model
}
\description{
Fit a generalized linear model, specified by a response variable, a set of predictors, and a description of the error distribution.
}
\usage{
h2o.glm(x, y, data, family, nfolds = 10, alpha = 0.5, lambda = 1e-05, tweedie.p)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A vector containing the names of the predictors in the model.
}
  \item{y}{
The name of the response variable in the model.
}
  \item{data}{
An \code{\linkS4class{H2OParsedData}} object containing the variables in the model.
}
  \item{family}{
A description of the error distribution and corresponding link function to be used in the model. Currently, Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, gamma, and Tweedie are supported.
}
  \item{nfolds}{
Number of folds for cross-validation. The default is 10.
}
  \item{alpha}{
The elastic-net mixing parameter, which must be in [0,1]. The penalty is defined to be \deqn{P(\alpha,\beta) = (1-\alpha)/2||\beta||_2^2 + \alpha||\beta||_1 = \sum_j [(1-\alpha)/2 \beta_j^2 + \alpha|\beta_j|]} so \code{alpha=1} is the lasso penalty, while \code{alpha=0} is the ridge penalty.
}
  \item{lambda}{The shrinkage parameter, which multiples \eqn{P(\alpha,\beta)} in the objective. The larger \code{lambda} is, the more the coefficients are shrunk toward zero (and each other).
}
  \item{tweedie.p}{The index of the power variance function for the tweedie distribution. Only used if \code{family = "tweedie"}.}

\value{
An object of class \code{\linkS4class{H2OGLMModel}} with slots key, data, model and xval. The slot model is a list of the following components:
\item{coefficients }{A named vector of the coefficients estimated in the model.}
\item{rank }{The numeric rank of the fitted linear model.}
\item{family }{The family of the error distribution.}
\item{deviance }{The deviance of the fitted model.}
\item{aic }{Akaike's Information Criterion for the final computed model.}
\item{null.deviance }{The deviance for the null model.}
\item{iter }{Number of algorithm iterations to compute the model.}
\item{df.residual }{The residual degrees of freedom.}
\item{df.null }{The residual degrees of freedom for the null model.}
\item{y }{The response variable in the model.}
\item{x }{A vector of the predictor variable(s) in the model.}
\item{auc }{Area under the curve.}
\item{training.err }{Average training error.}
\item{threshold }{Best threshold.}
\item{confusion }{Confusion matrix.}
The slot xval is a list of \code{\linkS4class{H2OGLMModel}} objects representing the cross-validation models. (Each of these objects themselves has xval equal to an empty list).
